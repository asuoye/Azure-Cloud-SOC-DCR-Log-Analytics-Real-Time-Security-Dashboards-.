<h1>Setting Up a Full Monitoring Flow with Azure DCR, Log Analytics, Dashboards, Queries & Trends for Cloud Security</h1>


<h2>Project Description</h2>
This project demonstrates how to design and implement a comprehensive cloud security monitoring pipeline in Microsoft Azure using Data Collection Rules (DCR), Log Analytics, and interactive dashboards. It focuses on collecting security-related telemetry, creating queries for incident detection, and visualizing trends for proactive threat response.


<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<b>You will build a fully functional monitoring setup for cloud security environments by:</b> 

- <b>Configuring Azure Data Collection Rules (DCR) to collect targeted log data from virtual machines, security tools, and Azure resources.</b>

- <b>Integrating logs into Azure Log Analytics for centralized storage and querying.</b>

- <b>Building interactive dashboards that display system health, security alerts, and historical trends.</b>

- <b>Writing custom KQL (Kusto Query Language) queries to detect anomalies, failed login attempts, and suspicious activities.</b>

- <b>Analyzing trend data to forecast and mitigate future threats.</b>


<h2>What You Will Learn</h2>

- <b>How to configure Azure DCR for specific log sources.</b>
- <b>Techniques for ingesting and storing logs securely in Azure Log Analytics.</b>
- <b>How to create KQL queries for targeted threat detection and root cause analysis.</b>
- <b>Designing custom dashboards for real-time and historical security insights.</b>
- <b>Interpreting security trends to enhance long-term cloud defense strategies.</b>


<h2>Why This Project Matters</h2>

- <b>Provides hands-on experience with enterprise-grade cloud security monitoring tools.</b>
- <b>Helps develop the ability to identify and respond to incidents quickly.</b>
- <b>Demonstrates practical skills sought after by SOC analysts, cloud security engineers, and threat hunters.</b>
- <b>Builds a portfolio project that proves you can turn raw security data into actionable intelligence.</b>


<h2>Practical Knowledge Youâ€™ll Gain:</h2>

- <b>End-to-end log collection and monitoring workflow in Azure.</b>
- <b>Writing efficient KQL queries for incident detection.</b>
- <b>Building professional dashboards for executive and operational reporting.</b>
- <b>Understanding the relationship between raw telemetry, analytics, and decision-making.</b>
- <b>Applying monitoring skills in both cloud and hybrid environments.</b>
